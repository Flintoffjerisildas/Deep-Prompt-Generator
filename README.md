# Deep Agent Prompt Generator

A multi-agent AI system designed to transform a simple user brief into a high-quality, "deep" prompt optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs). This project uses three specialized agents (Intent Analyst, Prompt Designer, and Prompt Creator) powered by the Groq API to ensure the final output is precise, structured, and effective—specifically tailored for Scala coding tasks but adaptable for others.

## Features

- **Three-Agent Pipeline**:
  - **Intent Agent**: Analyzes the user's brief to understand core objectives and implicit requirements.
  - **Design Agent**: Structures the perfect prompt blueprint based on the intent analysis.
  - **Creator Agent**: Synthesizes the final "Deep Prompt" using best practices and detailed examples.
- **Groq API Integration**: Leverages high-speed inference for rapid generation.
- **Markdown Output**: Automatically saves the generated prompt to a `.md` file for easy sharing and usage.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and tracking the generation process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Groq API Keys](https://console.groq.com/) (You need 3 keys, or you can reuse one key 3 times)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or navigate to the project directory):
    ```bash
    cd c:\Deep-Agent-Prompt-Generator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
      ```powershell
      .\venv\Scripts\Activate
      ```
    - **Windows (cmd)**:
      ```cmd
      .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
      ```
    - **Linux/Mac**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Groq API keys:
    ```env
    agent-1-api-key=your_api_key_here
    agent-2-api-key=your_api_key_here
    agent-3-api-key=your_api_key_here
    ```

## How to Run

You can run the generator by providing a brief directly via the command line or by pointing to a text file.

### Option 1: Direct Input
```bash
python main.py --brief "Create a Scala function to calculate Fibonacci numbers recursively"
```

### Option 2: From File
Create a file named `brief.txt` with your request, then run:
```bash
python main.py --file brief.txt
```

## Output

The system will generate a file named `deep_prompt_output.md` in the same directory. This file contains the ready-to-use prompt generated by the agents.
